Computed Properties

Javascript Object:  Javascript objects contain key-value pairs in which the key represents a property from which we can get and set the value of the object. Now we will see how to declare an object with a computed property name. 

Method 1:  We will use the expression within the [ ] (square bracket) to create the name of an object property. In ES6, it is possible to use an expression within brackets ‘[ ]’. Depending on the result of the expression, a property name will be assigned to an object. 

let LAST_NAME = "lastname";
let fullname = {
firstname: "somya",
[LAST_NAME]: "jain"
};
console.log(
"My fullname is: " + fullname.firstname
+ " " + fullname.lastname
);

Output
My fullname is: somya jain
 

Method 2:  In this method, We will create the property name of an object dynamically. As part of this method, we will dynamically create an object and add a property name and assign a value to that specific property in order to create a customized key-value pair.  

Syntax:

objectname["name of the property name"]=value
let LAST_NAME = "lastname";
    let fullname = {
        firstname: "somya"
    };
    fullname[LAST_NAME] = "jain";
    console.log(
        "My fullname is: " + fullname.firstname
            + " " + fullname.lastname
    );

Output
My fullname is: somya jain
