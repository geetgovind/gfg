Data Types

There are majorly two types of languages. First, one is Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types.

Example: C, C++, Java.

Other, Dynamically typed languages: These languages can receive different data types over time. For example- Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed (also called loosely typed) scripting language. That is in JavaScript, variables can receive different data types over time. Datatypes are basically typed data that can be used and manipulated in a program.

The latest ECMAScript(ES6) standard defines following data types: Out of which six data types are Primitive(predefined). 

Numbers: Represent both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.
String: A string is a sequence of characters. In JavaScript, strings can be enclosed within the single or double quotes. Example: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.
Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
Null: This type has only one value : null.
Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
Symbol: Unlike other primitive data types, it does not have any literal form. It is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol-that is unique. 
BigInt: The Bigint type represents the whole numbers that are larger than 253-1. To form a BigInt literal number, you append the letter n at the end of the number.
Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in detail in further articles.
