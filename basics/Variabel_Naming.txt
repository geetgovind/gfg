Variable Naming Convention

When we name variables in javascript, we have to follow certain rules. Each variable should have a name that appropriately identifies it. Your JavaScript code gets easier to comprehend and work with when you use suitable variable names. It is critical to name variables correctly. 

Note : Constants and global variables are always written in uppercase. 

 The following are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript:

Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
Only letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs are permitted in variable names.
Case matters when it comes to variable names.
A letter (alphabet), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($) must be the first character in a variable name, any other special characters must not be taken.
Certain terms such as reserved words in JavaScript should not be used to name variables.
A few more conventions for good practices:

It is good to decide on a case and continue it throughout the code. Example: camelCase. Code looks elegant and proper.
Name your variable with more than one word. This will verify that the name of your variable is accurate.
It is suggested not to use variable names that are too short. They do not make proper sense.
