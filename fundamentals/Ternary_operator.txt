JavaScript Ternary Operator

"Question mark" or "conditional" operator in JavaScript is a ternary operator that has three operands.

The expression consists of three operands: the condition, value if true and value if false.
The evaluation of the condition should result in either true/false or a boolean value.
The true value lies between "?" & ":" and is executed if the condition returns true. Similarly, the false value lies after ":" and is executed if the condition returns false.
Syntax:

condition ? value if true : value if false
Expression to be evaluated which returns a boolean value.
Value to be executed if condition results in true state.
Value to be executed if condition results in false state.
Examples:

Input: let result = (10 > 0) ? true : false;
Output: true

Input: let message = (20 > 15) ? "Yes" : "No";
Output: Yes
The following programs will illustrate conditional operator more extensively: Program 1: 


function gfg() {  
//JavaScript to illustrate 
//Conditional operator 

let age = 60 
let result = (age > 59)? 
"Senior Citizen":"Not a Senior Citizen"; 

console.log(result); 
}  
gfg();  


Output
Senior Citizen
 

An example of multiple conditional operators. Program 2: 

  
    function gfg() {  
    //JavaScript to illustrate
    //multiple Conditional operators

    let marks = 95;
    let result = (marks < 40) ? "Unsatisfactory": 
             (marks < 60) ? "Average":
             (marks < 80) ? "Good":"Excellent";

    console.log(result);
    }  
    gfg();  


Output
Excellent
