JS Iterating Over String

Whenever we are dealing with strings we need to iterate over them. There are basically two ways in which we can iterate over a string.

Firstly, we can simply use for(let char of message) to iterate through every character of the string. 

let message = "Hello Geeks";

//here char is a variable which takes the value of every letter in the message
for (let char of message){
	console.log(char);
}

Output
H
e
l
l
o
 
G
e
e
k
s
 

There can be many use case of iterating over a string. Let us discuss one simple use case using the above mentioned method: 

Problem: Find the number of times the letter 'e' occurs in our message.

let message = "Hello Geeks";

//a variable to keep tract of the instances of 'e'
let count=0;

for (let char of message){
	if(char === 'e'){
    	count++; //value of count will be incremented everytime we come across 'e'
    }
}
console.log("e occurs "+count+" times");

Output
e occurs 3 times
 

The Second way in which we can iterate over a string is using index, ie. position of a particular character in the string. 

let message = "Hello Geeks";

console.log(message[0]) //print char at position 0
console.log(message[6]) //print char at position 6
console.log(message[5]) //print char at position 5

Output
H
G
 
Note: Any special symbols or space is also a character in the string

Therefore if we want to iterate over the entire string using indexes we make use of for loop as bellow.

let message = "Hello Geeks";

//here i takes the value of index for every character 
for (let i=0;i<message.length;i++){
	console.log(message[i]);
}

Output
H
e
l
l
o
 
G
e
e
k
s
 

Now Solving the same problem(Find the number of times the letter 'e' occurs in our message.) using indexes.

let message = "Hello Geeks";

//a variable to keep tract of the instances of 'e'
let count=0;

for (let i=0; i<message.length; i++){
	if(message[i] === 'e'){
    	count++; //value of count will be incremented everytime we come across 'e'
    }
}
console.log("e occurs "+count+" times");

Output
e occurs 3 times
